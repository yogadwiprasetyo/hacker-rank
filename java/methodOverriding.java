/*

//* Note: When overriding a method, you should precede it with the @Override annotation. The parameter(s) and return type of an overridden method must be exactly the same as those of the method inherited from the supertype.

//* Task

Complete the code in your editor by writing an overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method that prints the same statement as the superclass' getNumberOfTeamMembers method, except that it replaces  with  (the number of players on a Soccer team).

//* Output Format

When executed, your completed code should print the following:

Generic Sports
Each team has n players in Generic Sports
Soccer Class
Each team has 11 players in Soccer Class

*/

// DEFAULT CODE
class Sports{
  String getName(){
    return "Generic Sports";
  }

  void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
    System.out.println( "Each team has n players in " + getName() );

// DEFAULT CODE
class Soccer extends Sports{
  // DEFAULT CODE
  @Override
  String getName(){
    return "Soccer Class";

  // FINISH TASK
